As a football fanatic, I would like to vote on trades so that no one team can bribe others under the table to trade good players to them.
I would like to talk to the players, to be able to convince them to join my time.(maybe)

As a soccer fanatic, I would like to have a system where the player losses value 



Exceptions:
If the user tries to draft a player they can't afford, the transaction would declined.
If the user tries to a 3rd player of the same position then they would get declined, because you can only have 2 players of the same position.
